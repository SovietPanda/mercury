Welcome to Mercury's |release| documentation!
=============================================

Overview
--------
Mercury is a set of services, agents, and hardware libraries designed for the
purpose of heterogeneous datacenter management.

Mercury provides two core facilities, a hardware inventory and RPC API
for firmware management, BMC configuration, RAID configuration,
OS provisioning, and secure decommissioning. Mercury has been developed
specifically for base systems management of large numbers of servers from
multiple vendors and generations, spread across multiple datacenters.

Mercury is approaching alpha status and is currently under **heavy** development.
All aspects of the project, be it code, structure, philosophy; are likely to change.
