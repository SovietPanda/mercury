Feature: List Active Computers
    As an authorized tenant
    I want to be able to see a list of my active_computers

    Background: Test GET /active/computers
        Given the account is an authorized tenant
        And the active_computers client URL is /active/computers

    # /active/computers
    @positive @p0 @smoke
    Scenario: Get list of active_computers
        When I get the list of active_computers
        Then the active_computers response status is 200 OK
        And the response contains a list of active_computers

    # /active/computers - bad method
    @negative @p1
    Scenario: Post instead of getting list of active_computers
        When I use post on active_computers
        Then the active_computers response status is 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED
